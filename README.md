#Task1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements.Here we used machine learning concept to classify the Iris flowers from these measurements into their respective species.The dataset used is Iris.csv


#TASK5 : SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation,and advertising platform selection.Advertising.csv file dataset is consider and linear regression technique is used.

#Task 4 : EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content. In this Project,we use Python to build an email spam detector.Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.
Here we are using logictic regression method and the dataset taken was spam.csv file.
